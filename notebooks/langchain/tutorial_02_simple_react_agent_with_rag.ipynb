A prevalência de Alzheimer aumenta com a idade, sendo menos comum em pessoas com menos de 65 anos.

      "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. It is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented postmortem or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is based on the biological construct rather than the clinical consequences of the disease. Biomarkers related to beta-amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration are used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in living persons. The disease is associated with brain changes, and it is one of the most burdensome diseases in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost (YLLs). It is more common in older individuals but can also affect younger people, with symptoms sometimes appearing before the age of 65.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease is not solely hereditary, but genetics can play a role in increasing the risk of developing the disease. Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's, particularly those with a parent or sibling with the disease, are more likely to develop it themselves. Genetic mutations in specific genes, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene and the presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes, can lead to a small percentage of Alzheimer's cases. Overall, Alzheimer's is believed to develop as a result of multiple factors rather than a single cause, with age, genetics, and family history being significant risk factors.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease is not solely hereditary, but genetics can play a role in increasing the risk of developing the disease. Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's, particularly those with a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with the disease, are more likely to develop Alzheimer's compared to those without a family history. Certain genetic mutations, such as mutations in the genes for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the presenilin proteins, can also significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's. However, it's important to note that not all cases of Alzheimer's are hereditary, and other factors such as age and lifestyle also contribute to the risk of developing the disease.\n",

      "Alzheimer's disease is not solely hereditary, but genetics can play a role in increasing the risk of developing the disease. Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's, particularly those with a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with the disease, are more likely to develop Alzheimer's compared to those without a family history. Certain genetic mutations, such as mutations in the genes for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the presenilin proteins, can also significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's. However, it's important to note that not all cases of Alzheimer's are hereditary, and other factors such as age and lifestyle also contribute to the risk of developing the disease.\n",

A resposta é que o Alzheimer não é exclusivamente hereditário, mas a genética pode desempenhar um papel no aumento do risco de desenvolver a doença. Ter um histórico familiar de Alzheimer e certas mutações genéticas podem aumentar significativamente o risco de desenvolver a doença. No entanto, outros fatores, como idade e estilo de vida, também contribuem para o risco de desenvolver o Alzheimer.\n",
